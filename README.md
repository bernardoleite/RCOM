# Computer Networks

### Description

We have made two projects:

* First Project: "Data Link Protocol" - The main purpose of this work is firstly to implement a data link protocol capable of providing a reliable data communication service between two systems connected by a transmission medium, a serial cable. Secondly, test the protocol with a simple file transfer application.

* Second Project: "Part 1 - Development of a Download Application" and "Part 2 - Configuration and study of Network" - The objectives for this project were fulfilled, that is, the configuration of the router and switch that we used to develop the application allow the transfer, via FTP, without any errors. The network was also configured successfully.
